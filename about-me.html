                <p>Born in Melbourne I followed the usual course of studies and nabbed myself a Bachelor of Business from <em>RMIT University</em>. My first role out of university was largely an operations role and I quickly found myself feeling unfulfilled with no clear career trajectory.
                <br><br>
                With a burning desire to work overseas and search for a more interesting career I quit my job and moved to Hong Kong, finding employment as an IT Business Analyst with an Australian based consulting firm after some months. I would spend 2 wonderful years working in varied and interesting IT projects before the company succumbed to the effects of COVID-19.
                <br><br>
                The 2 years after that would see me working at a bank again as a Business Analyst, moreso as a change manager. Halfway through this role I began casually exploring software development in my free time which lit an evergrowing fire that kept me asking the same question: <strong><em>What if?</em></strong></p>

                <p>In my free time I'm usually trying to stay fit in the gym or having a hit at the local squash courts. When the weather's nice I like to venture a little further out and try my hand at fishing (usually with little to no success). After the sun goes down I'm most likely playing computer games, watching anime or playing board games with mates.</p>
